**ZZANET** (AS4242422811) is a research network run by [Evan Pratten](https://va3zza.com). This network announces both DN42 and public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

For the time being, the FFIXP network is piggybacking off the ZZANET backbone routing gear for cost-saving reasons. As the FFIXP traffic flow grows, these projects will be physically separated to different servers (with the goal of the FFIXP router being colocated to a peering facility in the Toronto area).
