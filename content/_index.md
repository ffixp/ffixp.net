**FFIXP** (the *Freeform Internet Exchange*) is a virtual internet exchange that aims to support experimentation with an extremely low cost overhead. Our goal is to allow anyone to play with internet backbone technologies in a reasonably safe, yet powerful way.

We can provide public IPv6 addresses to our members, as well as private IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for experimentation.

## What we are not

**FFIXP** is not designed to route much in the way of "real" internet traffic. None of the networking gear involved is capable of doing much more than a few webservers and some light video streaming. While we can provide public IP addresses, they are not to be relied upon as a primary connectivity source in heavy traffic environments. This project is for trying ideas, not running production-grade services.

## Joining FFIXP

Unlike your standard IXP, we are able operate over various connection mediums, including:

- Virtual Private Networks
- Direct packet radio links
- Amateur WIFI (AREDN)
- Physical device connections

To join the network, just shoot an email over to `join@ffixp.net` (responses may come from another address). We will work out the best connection medium for you.

Don't have your own IP space to bring to the network? No worries, we can let you route a portion of one of ours back to us so you can get some experience working with BGP, while we handle interacting with the *real world* for you. This means, you don't even need an ASN, we can give you a private one.
