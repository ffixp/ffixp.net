**FFIXP** (the *Freeform Internet Exchange*) is a virtual internet exchange for connecting experimental and research networks in a reasonably safe and controlled manner. Our goal is to allow anyone access and experiment with internet backbone technologies with a low barrier to entry and extremely low cost overhead.

This project is operated, funded, and coordinated by [Evan Pratten](https://va3zza.com). More info and project updates may be found in his [blog](https://va3zza.com/blog).

## What we provide

**FFIXP** itself is simply an internet exchange that operates over tunnels and virtual private networks. The exchange is not geographically restricted and is not limited to a single country (although far away routers will see higher latency).

### Our current infrastructure

Currently, **FFIXP** has routers running in the following locations (more to come soon):

| Datacenter  | City                    | Network        |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Equinix TR2 | Toronto Ontario, Canada | 1gbps ethernet |
